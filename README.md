StreamNet implemented in Golang.


## Install
### From Binary
(not supported yet)

### From Source
You'll need `go` [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) first.

#### Get Source Code

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/triasteam
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/triasteam
git clone https://github.com/triasteam/go-streamnet.git
cd go-streamnet
```

#### Compile

```bash
make install
```

to put the binary in `$GOPATH/bin` or use:

```bash
make build
```

to put the binary in `./build`.


__The binary's name is '**sng**', which is standing for StreamNetGo and is shorter.__

## Run
```bash
./build/sng
```
